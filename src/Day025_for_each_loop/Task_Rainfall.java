	Question:
	Write a program that stores the name of each month in an array of Strings, 
	and the rainfall for each month of the year into an array of doubles. The 
	program should determine the total rainfall for the year, the average monthly 
	rainfall, and the months with the most and least amount of rain. You will 
	need: Two one-dimensional arrays - one to store the names of each month and 
	another to store the rainfall for each month. 
	
	(What would be the size of these arrays?)
	
	Use an initialization list to store the names of each month into the String 
	array. A for loop to receive the values of rainfall. You should refer to 
	your string array to get the names for the appropriate month. The rainfall 
	values should be stored in the doubles array. Make sure the user does not 
	enter a negative value for rainfall. (Use a while loop for this part)
	
	A for loop to compute the running sum A variable to store the average A 
	for loop (with a nested if statement) to determine the largest amount of 
	rainfall in the doubles array You need to refer to the String array to 
	indicate the month with the largest rainfall.
	
	A for loop (with a nested if statement) to determine the smallest amount 
	of rainfall You need to refer to the String array to indicate the month 
	with the largest rainfall.

		Explanation:
		The java program Rainfall prompts the user to enter 12-month rainfall 
		in an array, rain. Then find the total, average, largest and smallest 
		rainfall of the year. The program validates the user input for rainfall 
		using while loop. The names of the 12 months are stored in a string array 
		called a month. The NUM_MONTH is a constant variable to set the number 
		of months in a year. To find the total rainfall amount, iterate over the 
		array, rain then finds total rainfall value. The average rain fall is 
		calculated by dividing the total by NUM_MONTHS. To find the largest rain 
		fall and mont of the largest rain fall is calculated by assuming the 
		largest rain fall is the first value in rain array. Later, using the for 
		loop, determine the actual largest value by comparing the largest with the 
		rain array values. Similarly, to find the smallest rain fall and month of 
		the smallest rain fall is calculated by assuming the smallest rain fall 
		is the first value in rain array. Later , using the for loop , determine 
		the actual smallest value by comparing the smallest with the rain array 
		values. Print the total, average, largest and smallest rain fall values 
		on the java console output.
